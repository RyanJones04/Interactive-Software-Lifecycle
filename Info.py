req = """This is the of the five main phases of the waterfall model as shown previously. In this phase
all of the possible requirements for the system are captured and documented. This
information can be collected in a number of ways, some of the most popular being
interactive brainstorming within the team or interviewing and questionnaires to find
popular opinions. A feasibility analysis should also be done to make sure that the
requirements are valid and possible. Other factors should also be considered such as
time and budget constraints.

By the end of this phase, your projects requirements should be clear and a
Requirements Understanding Document or RUD should be created and distributed
between those who need it.
"""
des = """The next stage is the design of the project or what ever is being created.
In this stage uses the specifications from the previous stage in order to create a
concrete solution concept. A detailed construction plan should be created and
concentrated on specifics of the final product.

This can also be split into two different sections, logical design and physical
design. The logical design consists of the initial design in which a basic plan
is created and the project is decomposed into any required modules and the
relationship between them.

The physical design is then created using the logical design to give a more
detailed idea of the final product and becomes something that should be able
to be used in the implementation phase as it should reflect the final
product enough to be easy to copy from.
"""

imp = """This next phase or the implementation phase is probably the most important phase as it is
when the product is actually built. It can be done in many ways but for larger
projects it will normally be broken down into smaller parts or units. These units are
then brought together and made into the product. The person or team creating the
product will take information from both previous phases to ensure that the product
reflects exactly what has been planned and presented previously.

Sometimes these units are only written individually in this stage and then come
together to form the full product in an extra stage which is sometimes called the
integration stage. This is to show that each unit should be tested before being
integrated together.

However, this doesn’t mean that this model doesn’t test each unit first as each
part should be tested meticulously before being integrated together since it
is much harder to solve issues when it is not broken down. 
"""

ver = """The next phase of the waterfall model is called the verification phase or the testing phase.
Both mean the same thing which is when the product is put through several different
types of testing procedures to make sure that it does what it is supposed to. Things
that might be checked during this phase is that the product actually performs its
intended purpose and that there are no bugs or errors that need to be fixed.

The product may be tested internally by staff to start with and then moved to be
tested by a certain number of members of the public. This is to make sure that
enough none biased opinions are given on the project and if anything could be
improved or changed then that can be said.

However, in the real world it is rare that this much testing goes into most
products and it as long as it works with no errors or faults then the next
stage will be moved to quickly.
"""

mai = """The next and final phase of the waterfall model is the maintenance stage. This stage is after
the product has been deployed and involves post deployment services to the client or
customer. If issues are later found that were not originally found in testing then
patches or updates can be released to fix them later down the line. In a perfect
world there would be in post deployment issues however, that is nearly impossible
and rarely happens. The fixes can normally be done quite quick and do not normally
have that big of an affect as anything that is detrimental to the product will most
likely be found during the verification phase.

This phase is not only for fixes and can also be used to improve the product. If
the team has a new idea that they want to implement then that can be done or even if
a customer gives a good idea or an idea that gets a lot of support then that can
normally be integrated as well. However, this phase only really works if the product
is not entirely tangible, if some kind of software is involved in the product then
this is when this phase is used.
"""

ini = """The initiation phase is the first stage of the project management life cycle. Its main
objective is to develop and turn an abstract idea into a final and meaningful goal.
For this to be done, a business case must be developed to define the project on a
broader level. This may be done through something called a project character which
would consist of details of the project, such as constraints, goals, budget and
expected time line. This phase only outlines a clear goal for the project and will
not contain any technical details that would instead be outlined in the planning stage.

This phase is quite similar to the first stage of the Waterfall model. However, the
main difference is that the requirements stage of the Waterfall model will plan the
project in much more depth than this initiation phase. This phase is more like a
combination of the initiation phase and the planning phase of the project management
life cycle.
"""

pla = """The second phase of the project management life cycle is the planning stage. This stage
should go into great detail of the project’s roadmap. Some places even recommend
that this phase is expected to take close to half of the entire project’s timespan.
The primary tasks of this phase include identifying technical requirements, developing
a detailed project schedule and setting up goals. There are multiple ways or
structures that are used to achieve this, however, S.M.A.R.T and C.L.E.A.R are
two of the most popular.

SMART stands for specific, measurable, attainable, realistic and timely. It is
a method that is used to ensure goals are critically analysed and are deemed
achievable. This is a great method for reducing risk early within a project.

CLEAR stands for collaborative, limited, emotional, appreciable and refinable.
This is a method that is designed to fit in to the dynamic nature of a modern
work place and works well in a fast-paced environment.

This phase doesn’t differ too much from the adjacent phase of the waterfall
model since they are both planning in extensive detail. However, the main
difference is that a project does not need a design which is made in the
waterfall cycle.
"""

exe = """This next stage is the execution phase and it is when the work for the project will actually
be completed. As a project manager the main role is to establish an efficient work
flow and carefully monitor the progress of the team. Another role of a project manager
during this phase is to make sure that effective communication between stakeholders
remain. This is to ensure that everyone stays on the same page and the project can
continue without issue. Most projects will take advantage of collaborative software
that can help with this issue. This can also then improve efficiency and increase
productivity within the work force.

This also barely differs from the third stage of the waterfall model as they
both include the main body of work being done. The only difference is that this
cycle does not really define a method of working as this would be left to the
works. However, in the waterfall model it is described how the work should
be completed.
"""

mon = """This is stage in the process is not actually performed in a sequential manor. This phase and
the previous execution phase run simultaneously to ensure that objectives are met
correctly. During this phase a project manager is responsible for tracking the
effort and the cost of the process as it continues. This tracking ensures that
the project is being completed correctly and also remains within the budget
specified in previous phases. It also is used to make sure that the plan is not
deviated from by including critical success factors and key performance indicators.

This is quite close to the adjacent stage of the waterfall model but is not as
similar as the other stages. This is mainly due to this stage being ran simultaneously
to the execution stage while the waterfall model is ran completely sequentially.
However, they are quite similar as they perform the same function of making sure
the project is at the correct stage and is meeting the goals that are laid out in
the plans.
"""

clo = """This is the final phase of the project management life cycle. This stage is used for the final
processes of a project including things like the final delivery and any paperwork
that may be needed to be finalised. This may include terminating the contracts of any
external works that have been hired for the project. Most of the time a project
reflection meeting is also held for the team. In this meeting the successes and
failures of the project would be highlighted and discussed. This can be a very
effective method of ensuring improvement within the organisation and to help to
enhance future productivity of the team.

This phase differs quite a lot from the final stage of the waterfall model being
maintenance. This is since the maintenance phase is used to continue the development
of the product past its release and to ensure customer satisfaction. However, the
project management life cycle is more about managing a team and a project rather
than the product itself so this kind of future development is not needed within
this cycle. Once the project is closed it is over.
